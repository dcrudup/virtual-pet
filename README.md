***I attempted to make the changes suggested during the 5/22/18 one-on-one call. Unfortunately, those changes made my code act "funky," but I'm too tired to figure it out now (@10:30 p.m.). I will make the changes to the code in the morning. If I can figure out the funkiness, I will push a revised code before the 9:00 a.m. deadline.
